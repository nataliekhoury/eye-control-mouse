# Eye-Controlled Mouse Using Python
This project is an assistive technology application that enables hands-free computer interaction using eye movement tracking. It leverages Mediapipe for facial landmark detection and OpenCV for real-time video processing.

Key Features
âœ… Tracks eye movement using a webcam
âœ… Moves the cursor based on eye gaze direction
âœ… Detects eye blinks for left/right clicks
âœ… Provides a hands-free alternative for accessibility

Technologies Used
Python
Mediapipe (for face and eye tracking)
OpenCV (for real-time video processing)
PyAutoGUI (for controlling the mouse)
How It Works
Captures live video from a webcam
Detects facial landmarks and extracts eye position
Maps eye movement to mouse cursor movement
Detects blinks for clicking actions
Provides a smooth and responsive user experience
Applications
ðŸ”¹ Assistive technology for people with disabilities
ðŸ”¹ Hands-free computer interaction
ðŸ”¹ Human-computer interaction (HCI) research
